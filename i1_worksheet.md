Iteration 1 Worksheet
=====================

Adding a feature
-----------------

Tell the story of how one of your features was added to the project.
Provide links to the
feature, user stories, and merge requests (if used), associated tests, and merge commit
that was used complete the feature.

Use one or two paragraphs which can have point-form within them.

Exceptional code
----------------

Provide a link to a test of exceptional code. In a few sentences,
provide an explanation of why the exception is handled or thrown
in the code you are testing.

Branching
----------

Provide a link to where you describe your branching strategy.

Provide screen shot of a feature being added using your branching strategy
successfully. The [GitLab Graph tool can do this](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/comp3350-summer2019/cook-eBook/-/network/develop),
as well as using `git log --graph`.

SOLID
-----

Find a SOLID violation in the project of group `(n%16)+1` (group 16 does group 1).
Open an issue in their project with the violation,
clearly explaining the SOLID violation - specifying the type, provide a link to that issue. Be sure
your links in the issues are to **specific commits** (not to `main`, or `develop` as those will be changed).

Provide a link to the issue you created here.

Agile Planning
--------------

Write a paragraph about any plans that were changed. Did you
'push' any features to iteration 2? Did you change the description
of any Features or User Stories? Have links to any changed or pushed Features
or User Stories.

 
We decided to include create a round, complete a round, and main menu as features for the first iteration. 
And there are 10 user stories related to thses 4 features for iteration one.During our iteration one planning,
tasks were divided among us based on the user stories. Everyone completed the tasks related to their user 
story by the end of the iteration, so no user story or feature is pushed to iteration 2.
